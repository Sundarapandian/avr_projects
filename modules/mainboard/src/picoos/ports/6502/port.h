 *  LOCKING (DISABLE INTERRUPTS IN CRITICAL SECTIONS) 
 *-------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

/** @defgroup lock Configuration: Disable / Enable Interrupts
 * @ingroup configp
 * The operating system must be able to disable the interrupts on the
 * processor for a short time to get exclusive access to internal data
 * structures. There are three possible ways to solve this:<br>
 *
 * 1) Most processors have assembler commands that directly allow
 * disabling and enabling interrupts. When the operating system needs
 * to get exclusive access to any data, it will disable interrupts,
 * access the data and enable interrupts again. The disadvantage of
 * this simple way is that if the processor had disabled interrupts
 * before the OS entered the critical section, the OS will reenable the
 * interrupts again after it left the critical section regardless if
 * interrupts were disabled before.<br>
 *
 * 2) A better way is to save the current processor state before disabling
 * interrupts. Much processors support a "push flags to stack" OP-Code
 * for this purpose. When the operating system enters a critical section,
 * it will push the processor flags to the stack and disables the interrupts.
 * Then, when the operating system will left the critical section again,
 * it simply restores the old processor state by popping the last
 * processor state from the stack. If interrupts where enabled before,
 * it just became enabled now.<br>
 *
 * 3) There are some processors which have no OP-code for directly pushing
 * the processor flags (=PSW, Processor Status Word) directly to the stack.
 * For this processors, you can define a local variable which will hold
 * the original PSW when the operating system enters the critical section.
 * If your processor has enough general purpose register, you may define
 * the variable as register variable for fastest possible access. This is
 * truly better than pushing the flags to the stack.
 * @{
 */

/** Enable local flags variable.
 * When this define is set to 1, a user defined variable will be
 * generated for storing the current processor state before
 * disabling interrupts. Then the define ::POSCFG_LOCK_FLAGSTYPE
