/*
 * This file is originally from the pico]OS realtime operating system
 * (http://picoos.sourceforge.net).
 *
 * This is a simple test program, that demonstrate the use of mutexes.
 * Three tasks read a global summe, wait and write then the summe + 1
 * back. This critical block is protected by a mutex.
 * If you comment the mutex out, at the end you will see, that summe
 * has a wrong value.
 *
 * --- build ---
 *
 * 1. Set in the makefile in directory $(picoos-root)/ports/avr/test
 *    SRC_TXT = mutexSumme.c
 *
 * 2. You can then build the test by navigate to $(picoos-root)/ports/avr/test
 *    directory an type "make".
 *
 * 3. Now, in the directory $(picoos-root)/out/avr/deb should be a .elf,
 *    .cof and a .hex file.
 *
 * 4. You can open the .cof file with AvrStudio and watch, how pico]OS
 *    work.
 *    With the hex-file you can program the target device and run the
 *    program in the real world :-)
